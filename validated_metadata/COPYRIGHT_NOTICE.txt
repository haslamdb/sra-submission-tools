Description:
BioGPU is a domain-specific language (DSL) and GPU-accelerated framework for 
high-performance bioinformatics analysis. It includes a custom compiler, parser,
and CUDA-based algorithms for genomic sequence analysis, antimicrobial resistance
detection, and metagenomic profiling.

Key Components:
1. Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with custom grammar
2. LLVM-based compiler and code generator
3. GPU-accelerated algorithms for sequence analysis
4. Antimicrobial resistance detection pipeline
5. Metagenomic profiling tools
6. Clinical report generation system
